### Greener Pastures
_**Why good is never good enough.**_

I grew up playing video games. Whatever was the most recent and fashionable on the market I owned it. First was the Super Mash Bros. series that I played on the Nintendo consoles; starting with Nintendo 64, Nintendo Gamecube, and Nintendo Wii. Second was the Halo franchise I played on Microsoft's consoles; starting with the original Xbox, then Xbox 360, followed by Xbox One. The greatest time sink was World of Warcraft, which required a subscription of $30 per month; a game I played on my first custom built PC. The winding point here is I followed the trends when selecting what games to play and I spent the majority of my savings to do it. For the last four years I've played one game, Dwarf Fortress, which asserts "Losing is fun!". Dwarf Fortress is a part construction and management simulation, part roguelike, indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. It's free, donation-driven development, and is one of those rare games with unlimited replay value. In other areas of my life I want to do the same; making purchases that optimize for long-term happiness and are not driven by short-term market forces.
